<h2>About Me</h2>
<p>Hello, My name is Timothy McCoy and I am in the Web Design program. My favorite things are technology, Music, and Martial Arts. I already knew basic Web Design from high school but I came here to Full Sail to learn how to professionally design and code. I am truly enjoying this school and the people I met here and I intend to stay here for awhile after I finish my schooling.</p>

<h2>About Me</h2>
<p>Hello, My name is Timothy McCoy and I am in the Web Design program. My favorite things are technology, Music, and Martial Arts. I already knew basic Web Design from high school but I came here to Full Sail to learn how to professionally design and code. I am truly enjoying this school and the people I met here and I intend to stay here for awhile after I finish my schooling. Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing elit.

    <section>
    <img src="images/Header.png" alt="header">
    <h2>Header</h2>
    <p>Represents the title or header of a document or section of a document. The element is typicaly used to group a set of h1-h6 elements to mark up a page's title with its subtitle or tagline.</p>
    <h3>Content Visualization</h3>
    <p>I plan to put a simple text header at the top of my site and use the header html 5 element to do so.</p>
    </section>
    
    <section>
    <img src="images/CTA.png" alt="cta">
    <h2>CTA</h2>
    <p>An advertising and marketing concept, a request/direction to 'do something'- often the next step that a consumer could take toward the purchase of a product or service.</p>
    <h3>Content Visualization</h3>
    <p>After the header I will make a section tag to contain the picture or other media for the cta and then an affordance button.</p>
    </section>
    
    <section>
    <img src="images/Features.png" alt="features">
    <h2>Features/About</h2>
    <p>Section where the company or entity tells about themselves or shows their featured items or products for the user's viewing pleasure.</p>
    <h3>Content Visualization</h3>
    <p>I would make different sections and float them next to each other then insert an image or icon with a description or caption below it showing featured items.</p>
    </section>
    
    <section>
    <img src="images/Blog feed.png" alt="blogfeed">
    <h2>Blog Feed</h2>
    <p>A blog usually consists of regularly scheduled posts on one or more topics, written by one or more authors.</p>
    <h3>Content Visualization</h3>
    <p>I plan to use a section with an image in that section to show what the discussion will be about or have a picture of a desk of some sort to signify a discussion board with a comment option below it and recent posts.</p>
    </section>
    
    <section>
    <img src="images/footer.png" alt="footer">
    <h2>Footer</h2>
    <p>The footer element typically contains metadata about its enclosing section, such as who wrote it, links to related documents, copyright data, contact info, etc.</p>
    <h3>Content Visualization</h3>
    <p>I will make a simple footer using the html 5 footer element and put a copyright section at the very bottom and list items with anchor tags on them to signify links above that to go to other sections of the site.</p>
